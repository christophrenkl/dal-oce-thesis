<p>Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses.  Students who use GUI-based document
preparation systems should be able to meet the demands without great
intellectual effort.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for students who use
LaTeX, which is not designed to let writers manipulate formats easily.  This
poses a problem, because switching from LaTeX to a GUI-based system is not a
sensible option for students whose theses contain significant mathematical
notation.</p>

<p>To ease the burden, Dalhousie students and faculty members have developed a
set of LaTeX style sheets. The present website provides one of these,
<code>ocethesis.cls</code>, and its associated bibtex style sheet,
<code>ocethesis.bst</code>, along with sample postgraduate and undergraduate
thesis documents.</p>

<p>The links on the left of this page indicate how to install and use the
thesis style, and how to report bugs. Readers interested in following or
contributing to the development process should visit the <a
href="https://github.com/dankelley/dal-oce-thesis">development website</a>.</p>

<p>Many people have contributed to this latex style sheet. The version under
discussion here is maintained by Dan Kelley (Department of Oceanography). A
version with similar ancestry is maintained by members of Dalhousie's Faculty
of Computing Science; for more, visit <a
    href="http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis">Vlado Keselj's website</a>.
The ancestors of these two versions go back for decades, to the early days of
latex.</p>
