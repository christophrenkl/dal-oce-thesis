<p>Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses.  Students who use GUI-based document
preparation systems should be able to meet the demands through manual tweaking
of the document. For many students, particularly for those whose theses contain
significant mathematical notation, such GUI-based systems are unweildy and
unreliable, and the alternative of choice is LaTeX. However, the power of LaTeX
resides in the separation of the writer and the style for document preparation
(e.g.  through a "document class" or "style file"), and as a result it is not
simple for writers to manipulate the format rules.</p>

<p>To ease the burden, Dalhousie students and faculty members have developed a
set of LaTeX style sheets. The present website provides one of these,
<code>ocethesis.cls</code>, and its associated bibtex style sheet,
<code>ocethesis.bst</code>, along with sample postgraduate and undergraduate
thesis documents.</p>

<p>The links on the left of this page indicate how to install and use the
thesis style, and how to report bugs. Readers interested in following or
contributing to the development process should visit the <a
href="https://github.com/dankelley/dal-oce-thesis">development website</a>.</p>

<p>Many people have contributed to this latex style sheet. The version under
discussion here is maintained by Dan Kelley (Department of Oceanography). A
version with similar ancestry is maintained by members of Dalhousie's Faculty
of Computing Science; for more, visit <a
    href="http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis">Vlado Keselj's website</a>.
The ancestors of these two versions go back for decades, to the early days of
latex.</p>
