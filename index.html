<h2>Author</h2>

<p>Many people at Dalhousie have contributed to this latex style sheet. The
version under discussion here is maintained by Dan Kelley (Department of
    Oceanography). A version with similar ancestry is maintained by members of
        Dalhousie's Faculty of Computing Science; for more, visit <a
            href="Vlado Keselj's
        website">http://web.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/</a>.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses.  Students who use GUI-based document
preparation systems should be able to meet the demands without great
intellectual effort.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for students who use
LaTeX, which is not designed to let writers manipulate formats easily.  This
poses a problem, because switching from LaTeX to a GUI-based system is not a
sensible option for students whose theses contain significant mathematical
notation.</p>

<p>To ease the burden, Dalhousie students and faculty members have developed a
set of LaTeX style sheets. The present website provides one of these,
<code>ocethesis.cls</code>, and its associated bibtex style sheet,
<code>ocethesis.bst</code>.</p>

<p>Readers should note that these style sheets also support Honours theses; see
the <code>mythesis-honours-coop.tex</code> file provided here.</p>


<p>See the "Installation" link at the left for installing
<code>dal-oce-thesis</code>.  You will find several files, of which the most
important are: the Dalhousie Oceanography thesis LaTex style
(<code>ocethesis.cls</code>), two bibliography style files
(<code>ocethesis.bst</code> and <code>ocethesisbib.sty</code>), a sample LaTeX
file for postgraduate work (<code>mythesis.tex</code>), a sample LaTeX file for
undergraduate work (<code>mythesis-honours-coop.tex</code>), and a sample
bibliography file (<code>literature.bib</code>).</p>

<h2>Using the style file</h2>

<p>Your first step should be to try to run the sample file named
<code>mythesis.tex</code> on your machine. (If you don't know how to run a LaTeX
file, you'll need to learn that from another source. Luckily, LaTeX is the
lingua franca of mathematically-inclined technical writing, so many resources
are available.)</p>

<p>Note that this sample file uses a figure, in the file <code>figure1.pdf</code>.
You'll need to find out how to work with whatever type of figures your software
creates. Do that and test it with this sample file, before going on. This will
be the biggest decision you'll have to make. The simplest scheme would be to
chat with another student who uses similar software to make figures.</p>

<p>Once you've got it working with figures, you should start changing some of the
blocks in which definitions are given for the thesis title, etc. Then it will
be time to start adding lines to include your various chapters and appendices.
At that stage -- which should be within an hour of your first experiment --
you'll be working on your thesis, and you won't have to think about the format
again!</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ol>

    <li>The margins are 0.05 inches wider than the width specified by the
    Faculty of Graduate Studies.  This is to avoid problems that arise by
    slight displacements in different printers.

   <li>To get rotated captions and tables, put <code>\usepackage{lscape}</code> in the
   .tex file, and then put <code>\begin{landscape}</code> before content that is to go
   into landscape mode, and <code>\end{landscape}</code> to return to normal mode.
   (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>To get degree symbols with less typesetting, put
   <code>\usepackage{textcomp}</code> in your .tex file and then write e.g.
   <code>10\textdegree{}</code> instead of <code>10$^\circ$</code>.  (Thanks to John Foster for
   this hint.)

   <li>The title of the bibliography may be changed by putting something like
   <code>\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}</code> in the beginning of the .tex
   file.  (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)
