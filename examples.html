<p>Once you've installed as explained in the link to the left, you will find
that you have a file named <code>mythesis.tex</code> and that this contains a
thesis template. The easiest way to get started is to try running latex on
this. Once that works, try altering something in the document, perhaps the
title and author name. After a few minutes of this, you'll be ready to try
adding a citation to the bibtex file. Next, try hooking up a new figure. Once
you've got these things working, you will be ``cooking with gas'' as they once
used to say.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to make copies of what you've downloaded, in case
you mess things up. Bear in mind that the materials may change at any moment.
If you run into problems with formatting, check the "Bugs" link at the left.</p>
