<p>You will need to learn some latex before you can use the package
productively. There are many textbooks on latex, and many online tutorials.
    There are also online books, <a
        href="http://ctan.mirror.rafal.ca/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">"The
        not so short introduction to LaTeX 2e"</a> by Oetiker et al. (2014)
    being a highly-regarded example.</p>

<p>Once you've installed as explained in the <a
    href="http://dankelley.github.io/dal-oce-thesis/installation.html">
Installation</a> link, you will find that you have a file named
<code>mythesis.tex</code> and that this contains a thesis template. The easiest
way to get started is to try running latex on this. Once that works, try
altering something in the document, perhaps the title and author name. After a
few minutes of this, you'll be ready to try adding a citation to the bibtex
file. Next, try hooking up a new figure. Once you've got these things working,
you will be ``cooking with gas'' as they once used to say.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to make copies of what you've downloaded, in case
you mess things up. Bear in mind that the materials may change at any moment.
If you run into problems with formatting, check the <a

<p>A few notes and hints are listed below.</p>

<ol>

    <li>The margins are 0.05 inches wider than the width specified by the
    Faculty of Graduate Studies.  This is to avoid problems that arise by
    slight displacements in different printers.

   <li>To get rotated captions and tables, put <code>\usepackage{lscape}</code>
   in the .tex file, and then put <code>\begin{landscape}</code> before content
   that is to go into landscape mode, and <code>\end{landscape}</code> to
   return to normal mode.  (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>To get degree symbols with less typesetting, put
   <code>\usepackage{textcomp}</code> in your .tex file and then write e.g.
   <code>10\textdegree{}</code> instead of <code>10$^\circ$</code>.  (Thanks to
   John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>The title of the bibliography may be changed by putting something like
   <code>\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}</code> in the beginning of the
   .tex file.  (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>Long chapter or section headings can cover more than a single line in
   the table of contents. This is a problem because FGS requires such
   lines should be single spaced, not double-spaced like the rest of the 
   TOC. Many universities have this rule, and for some setups, a solution
   is to use the <code>tocloft</code> package. However, this package
   does not interact well with the present style sheet
   (or with sheets used at other universities). However, there is
   a good solution 
   for titles that span exactly two lines.
   This is illustrated in the <code>chapter1.tex</code>sample file, in
   the lines that look like the following.
<pre>
\chapter[\label{c:intro}\protect\vspace{-1.3ex}
Introduction: This Chapter Title is Very Long, so we Can See\\
if a fancy trick makes it single spaced]
{Introduction: This Chapter Title is Very Long, so we Can See
if a fancy trick makes it single spaced}
</pre>
   Place the hard hard break at the spot that latex normally breaks
   the line in the TOC. It may be necessary to alter the vertical space
   if your lines contain subscripts or superscripts.

   <li> The university requires PDF/A format for archiving.  Although there are
   supposedly ways to get latex to create this, the best scheme seems to be to
   prepare a normal PDF document and then to ask the university if they can
   provide software to make the conversion.
