<p>Once you've installed as explained in the <a
    href="http://dankelley.github.io/dal-oce-thesis/installation.html">
Installation</a> link, you will find that you have a file named
<code>mythesis.tex</code> and that this contains a thesis template. The easiest
way to get started is to try running latex on this. Once that works, try
altering something in the document, perhaps the title and author name. After a
few minutes of this, you'll be ready to try adding a citation to the bibtex
file. Next, try hooking up a new figure. Once you've got these things working,
you will be ``cooking with gas'' as they once used to say.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will need to make copies of what you've downloaded, in case
you mess things up. Bear in mind that the materials may change at any moment.
If you run into problems with formatting, check the <a

<p>A few notes and hints are listed below.</p>

<ol>

    <li>The margins are 0.05 inches wider than the width specified by the
    Faculty of Graduate Studies.  This is to avoid problems that arise by
    slight displacements in different printers.

   <li>To get rotated captions and tables, put <code>\usepackage{lscape}</code>
   in the .tex file, and then put <code>\begin{landscape}</code> before content
   that is to go into landscape mode, and <code>\end{landscape}</code> to
   return to normal mode.  (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>To get degree symbols with less typesetting, put
   <code>\usepackage{textcomp}</code> in your .tex file and then write e.g.
   <code>10\textdegree{}</code> instead of <code>10$^\circ$</code>.  (Thanks to
   John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>The title of the bibliography may be changed by putting something like
   <code>\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}</code> in the beginning of the
   .tex file.  (Thanks to John Foster for this hint.)

   <li>Long chapter or section headings can cover more than a single line in
   the table of contents. FGS will complain about this, stating that these
   lines should be single spaced and not double-spaced like the rest of the
   TOC. A web search reveals that other universities share this preference.
   Some have suggested using the <code>tocloft</code> package with various
   parameter settings, but this seems not to work with the present style sheet
   (or, it seems, with sheets used at other universities). One solution that
   works for titles that span just two lines is to hand-code a line position
   shift. This is illustrated in the <code>mythesis.tex</code>sample file, for
   the heading of chapter 1. The solution is to see where the line break occurs
   in the TOC, and then to insert a line-break sequence there, within a
   square-bracket portion of the chapter command, e.g. (direct from
   <code>chapter1.tex</code> of the example file):
<pre>
\chapter[\label{c:intro}\protect\vspace{-1.3ex}
Introduction: This Chapter Title is Very Long, so we Can See\\
if a fancy trick makes it single spaced]
{Introduction: This Chapter Title is Very Long, so we Can See
if a fancy trick makes it single spaced}
</pre>

</ol>
